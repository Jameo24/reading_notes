# Radius Concepts

Users new to RADIUS, EAP or AAA in general are encouraged to read the following standards:

RFC 2865 - Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)
RFC 2866 - RADIUS Accounting
and if working with EAP:

RFC 3748 - Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
RFC 3579 - RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service) Support For Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
This should provide a solid foundation in RADIUS and EAP at a protocol level.
The client sends the server a RADIUS authentication request. You don't decide what's in the request, the client does.
At the end of authorize, the server will check if anything set the Auth-Type.

If nothing did, it immediately rejects the request.

Lets suppose that the client sends a request with a User-Password attribute, and pap is enabled, the pap module will then have set Auth-Type = pap.

So in authenticate, the server will call the pap module again:
