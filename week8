# VirtualBox Network Settings Guide

Virtual machines must be able to connect to physical and virtual networks with their virtual network adapters. 
Virtual machines running on VirtualBox can be connected to different networks. VirtualBox provides multiple network modes for virtual machines.

Below, the following VirtualBox network modes will be discussed and compared:

Not Attached
NAT
NAT Network
Bridged Adapter
Internal Network
Host-Only Adapter
Generic Driver

Each VirtualBox VM can use up to eight virtual network adapters, each of which in turn is referred to as a network interface controller (NIC). 
Four virtual network adapters can be configured in the VirtualBox GUI (graphical user interface).
VirtualBox provides a long list of network modes, which is one of the most interesting features of VirtualBox network settings. 
Each virtual network adapter can be separately configured to operate in a different network mode.
