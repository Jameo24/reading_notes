# Understanding Network Data Delivery: Layers 2 and 3 of the OSI Model

# What Is Wireshark and How Is It Used?

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a series of layers through which computer systems use to communicate.
There are seven layers, and the networking layer would be layer 3. The network layer is responsible for packet forwarding,
including routing through intermediate routers. The data link layer, or layer 2, is the protocol layer that transfers data between
nodes on a network segment across the physical layer, or what is commonly known as a hostâ€™s physical address.

The OSI model has seven layers:

Physical
Data Link
Network
Transport
Session
Presentation
Application
