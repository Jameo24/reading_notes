# Traffic Mirroring 

Port mirroring, also known as SPAN or roving analysis, is a method of monitoring network traffic which forwards a copy of each incoming and/or
outgoing packet from one (or several) port(s) (or VLAN) of a switch to another port where the analysis device is connected.
Port mirroring can be managed locally or remotely.
The administrator can include either all packets in the port mirroring or only the transmitted /received packets. In case both transmitted and received packets are included, a packet going from a first monitored port to another monitored port will be copied twice to the destination port. This will have an impact on the measures and performance provided by the analysis device (e.g., retransmission rates, response times, …). APS captures and evaluates the data without any impact on the original traffic.

Please note that port mirroring may have some drawbacks, such as:

It can consume significant CPU resources while active
There is a risk of not receiving some packets (such as media errors)
In the case of traffic congestion at the switch level, port mirroring is likely to drop some traffic (because the SPAN process does not have priority)
In some cases, a better solution for long-term monitoring may be a passive TAP or an Ethernet repeater (”hub”)

Advantages of port mirroring
Low cost (this feature is embedded in most switches)
Can be configured remotely through IP or Console port
The only way to capture intra-switch traffic
A good way to capture traffic on several ports at once

Drawbacks of port mirroring
Not adequate for fully utilized full-duplex links (packets may be dropped)
Filters out physical errors
Impact on the switch’s CPU
Can alter the timing of the frame (with an impact on response time analysis)
SPAN has a lesser priority than port to port data transfer
