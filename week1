# Windows vs Windows Server

I am not a PC person so Windows 10 server does not mimic Window 10 to me.
I can tell the similarites since it is a windows product but it is very different.
Windows 10 excels at everyday use, while Windows Server manages many computers, files, and services.
But the similarities stop there. Microsoft designed Windows 10 for use as a desktop you sit in front of, and Windows Server as a server that runs services people access across a network. While Windows Server does have a desktop option.
